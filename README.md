# Basic_Improved_Pulse_Width_Modulation
## PWM:
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. It is a technique used in electronics and electrical engineering to control the average voltage or power supplied to a load by rapidly switching a signal on and off at a fixed frequency while varying the width of the on-time, also known as the duty cycle.

## Here's how PWM works:

Pulse Generation: A PWM signal consists of a series of pulses. The signal generator generates a high-frequency square wave signal with a fixed period (T).

### Duty Cycle:
The duty cycle is the percentage of time the signal is in the "on" state (high) during one period. It is usually represented as a percentage. For example, if the duty cycle is 50%, the signal is high for half of the period.

### Average Voltage/Power Control:
By changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, you can control the average voltage or power delivered to a load. A higher duty cycle corresponds to a higher average voltage or power, while a lower duty cycle corresponds to a lower average voltage or power.

### Applications:
PWM is commonly used in various applications, including motor control (to regulate the speed of motors), LED dimming (to control the brightness of LEDs), and power converters (to regulate voltage and current in electronic circuits).

### Frequency:
The frequency of the PWM signal determines how fast the on-off switching occurs. Higher frequencies can provide smoother control but may require more complex circuitry. Lower frequencies are easier to generate but can result in more noticeable flicker or ripple in the output.

PWM is a versatile technique that allows for precise control of electrical devices and is widely used in various electronic systems for tasks such as regulation, modulation, and control.
